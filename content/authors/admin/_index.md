I moved from the United Kingdom to the USA a long time ago which is why I have a pretty strange accent. I moved to Nashville to pursue a degree in Audio Engineering, but eventually switched to Mathematics with the nudge of a good friend and some close professors. After receiving my Bachelor's Degree, I then continued onto Vanderbilt University to get a Master's Degree in Biostatistics. I am currently a Data Scientist at naviHealth located in Brentwood, TN, and a professor of Statistics at Belmont. Outside of my passions of data science and teaching, I enjoy abstract painting whenever I get the chance. I have some pictures of my art pieces below which are avilable for purchase at https://atownabstract.etsy.com. Check 'em out!
